Please accept this mail as formal notice of my relieving from the position "Sr. Software Engineer" in LTI, with effect from today(28/10/2020).

The decision has been a difficult one but keeping my professional & personal priorities I have to take this step.
I take this opportunity to thank LTI for all the learning opportunities I was provided with during my 1.9 years at the organisation.
Please relieve me from current roles & responsibilities on 10th November, 2020.

If I can help to tie up any loose ends, please let me know. 

Thank you very much for the opportunity to work here.

Thanks again,
Nitesh Kumar
